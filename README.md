# Word Search Kata CLI

A Node.js command-line tool to solve word-search puzzles from a CSV file.

## Prerequisites

* Node.js (v14 or later)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/Hatim-HK/word-search-kata-program.git
cd word-search-kata-program

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

## Usage

At this stage, the CLI is a stub that accepts a CSV file path but does not yet solve the puzzle.

```bash
npm exec word-search -- ./path/to/puzzle.csv
```

## Running Tests

Unit tests are managed by Mocha/Chai. To run the (currently failing) initial stub tests:

```bash
npm test
```
